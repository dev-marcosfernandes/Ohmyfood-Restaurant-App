Project created while I was doing my internship as a student of OpenClassrooms.

It was my second project using HTML/CSS - only this time I tried some SASS' features to make my code more clean and functionnal. I did animations for the first time (hiding/showing/moving elements). 

This website was entirely created based on a responsive design approach.
